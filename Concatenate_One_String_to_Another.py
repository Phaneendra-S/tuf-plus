#You are given two strings str1 and str2.
#Write a program to concatenate str2 to the end of str1, and return the resulting combined string.
#Concatenation means joining both strings in their original order.


class Solution:
    def concatenate(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        # Your code goes here
        return str1+str2
